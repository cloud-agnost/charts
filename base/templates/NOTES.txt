📣  As a next step, you need to finalize your cluster set-up by creating your user account through Agnost Studio. 
📣  To launch Agnost Studio, type the URL or IP address of your cluster on your browser (e.g., http(s)://<your cluster URL or IP>). 
🌍  If you have installed your cluster locally you can access Agnost Studio at http://localhost
