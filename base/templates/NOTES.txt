{{ include (print $.Template.BasePath "/cluster-secrets.yaml") . | regexFind "clusterId.+" | replace "clusterId" "Cluster ID            " }}
{{ include (print $.Template.BasePath "/cluster-secrets.yaml") . | regexFind "clusterAcessToken.+" | replace "clusterAcessToken" "Cluster Access Token  " }}
{{ include (print $.Template.BasePath "/cluster-secrets.yaml") . | regexFind "accessToken.+" | replace "accessToken" "Engine Access Token   " }}
