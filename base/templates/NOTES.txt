👍  Agnost community cluster installation has started! 
⏳  It might take 5-10 minutes to complete the required deployments. Please check your cluster deployment status by running:
  
    kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

📣  As a next step, you need to finalize your cluster set-up by creating your user account through Agnost Studio. 
📣  To launch Agnost Studio, type the URL or IP address of your cluster on your browser (e.g., http(s)://<your cluster URL or IP>/studio). 
🌍  If you have installed your cluster locally you can access Agnost Studio at http://localhost/studio
